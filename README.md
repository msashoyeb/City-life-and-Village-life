# City life and Village life (OpenGL project)
Computer graphics project

## Description

- Here we include three different senario (Day mode, Night mode, Rain mode)
  
- We add sound system and live animations

- The scenario has three different modes: day, night, rain. To switch different mode key controlling system is used

## Appendix

The marine drive scenario is created with OpenGL in code blocks an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This is a beginner level project with 2d objects only. There are lots of ways to make the scenario more accurate and realistic. For future works, the rain mode cane be made more realistic using better animation effects. The houses cars and other object can be made more realistic by using 3D effect or projection. Overall, considering a beginner level project, it fulfilled all the goals and objectives. The group contains six members. All the group members are helpful and co-operative enough.
